        	Outage starting on 6/7/16.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					6/7: (<strong>30 minutes</strong>) Called and spoke to someone at Comcast. They had me reset the cable modem, to no avail. He claims to have scheduled a technician to come on 6/10, Friday. This person also offered a free speed increase and free TV for a year. I declined both offers explicitly.
				</p>
				<p>
					6/8: (<strong>18 minutes</strong>) Called again as service was still out. They said they would escalate the issue and get back in touch with me.
				</p>
				<p>
					6/9: (<strong>15 minutes</strong>)  No contact was made by anyone at Comcast. UPS tried to deliver something from Comcast. I rejected the delivery as I had not ordered anything. I called back as the service was still down. Spoke with Hashim and was told, yes, my account had been changed to add new services. I made sure that they rolled back any changes made to my account.
				</p>
				<p>6/10: (<strong>Call one, 10 minutes, hung up on… Call two, 30 minutes</strong>) Called at 9:50 to see where the technician is. Spoke to Patrick and was told that the person I spoke with yesterday (Hashim) had cancelled the technician’s appointment scheduled for today from 8-10am. Spoke to Michael on second call. He claimed that I have an appointment on 6/13 from 8-10am. After 10 minutes on the phone with him and being on hold, George picked up the phone and had no idea what was going on. Told George the whole story… He comes back on the line and asks if I can be around on hold until tomorrow for an appointment. He came back and said that he and his supervisor had called Dispatch for a same-day appointment. He said Dispatch would be calling me within 30 minutes to confirm. Ticket number: --- --- ---
				</p>
				<p>6/10: Part 2. (<strong>18 minutes, hung up on…</strong>)
					As of 11:15, no callback from Dispatch. Called back at 11:30am Spoke with Anna. She had no idea why the Dispatch would even call me, and saw not indication that they had ever planned to call me. After a hold, she confirmed that there was an appointment scheduled for Monday 8-10am, and that’s it. I asked to speak with her supervisor. She got back to me and said her supervisor couldn’t do anything but she could transfer me to a tech support supervisor instead.
				</p>
				<p>6/10: Part 3. (<strong>47 minutes, hung up on…</strong>)
					Called back… Spoke to Lee and immediately asked for supervisor. Supervisor Daniel, transferred me to Jake… Jake said he was sorry, but Dispatch wasn’t responding to his calls and that normally they have 24 hours as the expected contact window. He said he was sorry that expectations were set wrong. He chatted with his supervisor to ask for help and was put on hold at 26:00 into the call. Anthony, a supervisor, picked up after four minutes and told me he would check the status after running through the whole scenario again. Put back on hold, then called dropped after about 10 more minutes.
				</p>
				<p>6/10: Part 4.
					Giving up on phone. Moving to the internet, @comcastcares
